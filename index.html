        <p class="data">Welcome to my new Website....!!!!I got a book about exercise — one about high-intensity interval training, which is supposed to be especially good for burning fat. I started doing the exercises, although not for long enough to say whether it lowered my weight, especially since along with dieting I don’t really believe in weighing myself regularly. I was definitely increasing the amount I could exercise without exhausting myself, though. It felt good. I felt I was venturing out into hither unexplored personal territory, that of a Person Who Works Out. And then I got sick, and haven’t gotten better since.

            I read Health At Every Size, which is, at times, so counter to common knowledge it was like being told the sky isn’t blue (although as someone who grew up on the western side of San Francisco, I’ve had to take other people’s word on that one.) And a lot of it makes sense. The problem is there isn’t actually anything wrong with my health, or more precisely nothing wrong with my health that I expect a better diet or more exercise would help with. I don’t want to lose weight to improve my health, or to look more attractive, or to feel better about myself. I just want to fit onto Muni seats and be able to find pants easily again.I got a book about exercise — one about high-intensity interval training, which is supposed to be especially good for burning fat.
